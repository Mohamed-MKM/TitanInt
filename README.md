# TitanInt
TitanInt (A Big Integer Class in C++) is a custom implementation of a Big Integer (arbitrary precision integer) class in C++. Unlike built-in integer types (int, long long), which are limited by fixed size, TitanInt can store and operate on integers with hundreds, thousands, or even millions of digits, limited only by system memory.
